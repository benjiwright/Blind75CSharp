## Approach

5 weeks of Leetcode broken into categories: sequences, data structures, non-linear data structures, more data structures, and finally dynamic programming.

### Week 1 - Sequences

In week 1, we will warm up by doing a mix of easy and medium questions on arrays and strings. Arrays and strings are the most common types of questions to be found in interviews; gaining familiarity with them will help in building strong fundamentals to better handle tougher questions.

### Week 2 - Data structures

The focus of week 2 is on linked lists, strings and matrix-based questions. The goal is to learn the common routines dealing with linked lists, traversing matrices and sequence analysis (arrays/strings) techniques such as sliding window, linked list traversal and matrix traversal.
